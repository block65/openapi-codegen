#### Reasons for existing

- This replaces an already heavily used private project
- Other (good) versions of OpenAPI typescript generators uses templating (hb)
  and are a nightmare to modify
- This version (and proprietary version) are nicely treeshakeable and
  a very thin layer that is modestly unopionated
