#### Reasons for existing

- Replaces an already heavily used private project
- Best version of this OpenAPI generators uses templating (hb) and is a nightmare to mod (and barely maintained)
- good opportunity to simplify
- this version (and proprietary version) are nicely treeshakeable and
  modestly unopionated
